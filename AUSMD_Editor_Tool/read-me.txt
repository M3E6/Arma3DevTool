austin_medic's Arma 3 Editing Tool.

This tool requires .NET Framework 4.5 or higher, 
so it will only work on Operating Systems newer than windows XP.

The tool has various functions that can cut down on repetitive tasks,
and can help people new to coding to fill out parameters and have the program generate the code for them,
eliminating possible syntax errors that might otherwise occur.

Some of the forms are more dated than other ones and are more simple,
which was due to my limited experience with Visual Basic, I hope to
have most of the forms all looking similar and being consistent across all of them sometime in the future.
